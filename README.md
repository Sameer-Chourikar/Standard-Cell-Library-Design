The project is a course-project for EECT 6325: VLSI Design course at the Univerity of Texas at Dallas. I took the course in Fall 2019 semester. This is a series of projects where I, along with my partners Niket Kedarnath Ramani and Akilesh Sashank Akondi, designed a standard cell library and implemeted it to place and route a design consisting of 3700+ cells. The design features a RAM and an ALU. The standard cells were designed using 65nm technology in Cadence Virtuoso. HSPICE was used for verification of functionality. Place and route using Cadence Innovus and STA using Synopsys Primetime. The cells designed were:

INV,
NAND2,
NOR2,
XOR2,
MUX21,
AOI211,
AOI22,
OAI21,
D_ff

Please check out the six project reports to understand the step by step design procedure and implementation of the project.
