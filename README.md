This is a series of projects where we designed a standard cell library and implemeted it to place a route a design consisting of 3700+ cells. The design features a RAM and an ALU. The standard cells were desing using 65nm technology in Cadence Virtuoso. HSPICE was used for verification of functionality. Place and route using Cadence Innovus and STA using Synopsys Primetime. The cells designed were:

INV
NAND2
NOR2
XOR2
MUX21
AOI211
AOI22
OAI21
D_ff

Please check out the six project reports to understand the step by step design procedure and implementation of the project.
